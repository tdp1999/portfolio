## Notes

**On llm.txt for AI crawlers:**
This is a forward-thinking idea. An llm.txt file helps AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) accurately represent your work when users ask about you or your projects. It's low effort to implement and positions you as tech-savvy. Recommended to include in MVP.

**On animations:**
Keeping animations minimal aligns with your "clear and simple" philosophy. Consider only:
- Smooth page transitions (fade-in)
- Subtle hover states on interactive elements
- Avoid complex scroll-triggered animations that can feel gimmicky
